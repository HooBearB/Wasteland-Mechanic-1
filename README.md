# wasteland_mechanic
My first public python program, where you can play as a mechanic in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Or not. That's your choice.

This is by no means a finished product. This project *will* be disjointed hackwork. If anyone is brave enough to edit this, prepare for a headache on trying to figure out what does what. Apologies in advance.
